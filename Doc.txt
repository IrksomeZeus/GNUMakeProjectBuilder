        Returns:
            dict: Returns a dictionary object containing the build instructions for
                each project.
    
    readBuildVariants(file_path)
        Reads variants file and returns a list of the variants to build.
        
        Args:
            file_path (string): Path to the variants file.
        
        Returns:

            variant_data (list): List to store the lines of the variant file.
    
    updateBuildType(variant_file_path, build_type)
        Updates the variant BUILD_TYPE if changed.
        
        Args:
            variant_file_path (string): path to the variant file
            build_type (string): build configuration type to set
    
    writeVariantFile(variant_file_path, variant_data)
